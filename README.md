## üìã Project Overview

**next_major** is designed as a modern Next.js application that demonstrates:

- Secure, credentials-and-OAuth authentication  
- Role-based routing (e.g. `ADMIN` vs `USER`)  
- A polished UI with Tailwind CSS & lucide-react icons  
- Seamless Prisma integration with PostgreSQL  
- A standalone Python script (`train_deepfake_model.py`) to train a ResNet50-based deepfake detector  

This boilerplate can be your ‚Äúlaunchpad‚Äù for production apps that need both robust auth and custom ML workflows.

## ‚ú® Features

- **NextAuth.js** for email/password and social logins (GitHub, Google)  
- **JWT** sessions enriched with user roles  
- **Prisma** ORM + PostgreSQL migrations  
- **Tailwind CSS** & **Next.js 15 (app directory)**  
- **Python** script for training a deepfake detection model  
- Environment-driven config for safe secrets management
